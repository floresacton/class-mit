== Lab 2 part B

+ If first 20% of elements are used, then only the low frequencies come through, and it's barely understandable
+ If the sin terms are negated, then it's reverses the audio, because sin is the anti-symmetric part, while cos is already symmetric, this basically makes the signal f(t) = f(-t)
+ If cosine terms are zero, still legible, but hard to understand with extra noise because the signal has to be symmetric which makes it have artifacts
