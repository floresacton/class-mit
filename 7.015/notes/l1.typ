=== Definitions

DNA - information carrier\
RNA - information intermediate\
Reverse transcriptase (In some cases rna can become dna)\
RNA and DNA are nucleic acids

Protiens - provided cellular functions, structures\
- Ensymes - biological catalyst\
- Provide information

Gene - Stretch of DNA that codes for RNA and/or protein

Genotype - set of genes\
Phenotype - physical manifestation of that genotype

Fundamental 20th century science\
Gene, Atom, Bit (information)

=== 4 Types of expirements

1. Coorelations
  - DNA is in nuclei and is major component of chromosones
  - Soma cells 2N / germ cells 1N (germ cells have half the DNA)
  - Different species have different amounts of DNA

2. Show that something is Necessary\
  Done in 1944 by Avery\
  - Take S + heat treatment
  - Add DNase (these are ensymes)
  - Add RNase (chops up rna)
  - protienase (chops up protien)
  - After each, add it to Rough strand
  - Only the DNase kept the mouse alive (this means transformation needs DNA)
3. Something is Sufficient
  Show that the DNA is sufficient to transform the rough strand\
  - Purify DNA from S, then add it to the R strain
  - The mouse still died
  - Can purify DNA through chemical treatments (isolate different parts of cells)
  - People were skeptic that the DNA was pure enough and protiens remained
4. Seeing is believing
  1952 - Hershey/Chase
  - They were studying how viruses affected bacteria
  - Virses are protiens surrounding DNA
  - Infect ecoli, wait 20 minutes, the cell died, and now there are more viruses
  - Ecoli with T2 (50 viruses per ecoli)
  - Viruses called bacterio(phages)
  - P32 - allows DNA labeling, S35 - labels protiens
  - 20 minutes kills the ecoli
  - so expirement goes for 10 minutes (after infection)
  - Centerfuge sample (denser things go to the bottom)
  - Pellet at bottom, and supermatant ontop
  - Pellet contains P32, while supermatant had S35
  - This means the virus injected the DNA, while the protien stayed on the outside

=== Griffits Experiment
Strept pneumoniae - genetic transformation\
Smooth and rough\
Smooth killed the mice, but rough didn't

Took smooth strain and heated it up (killed the bacteria)\
(Smooth+heat)+Rough killed the mouse\
This means that rough strain aquired genetic material from the other ones

Conclusions
- R is transformed by something in S
- That must be a heritable factor

Not all bacteria pull DNA into environment from themselves

=== DNA Structure

+ Chemical composition
  - Polymer - each monomer -> sugar doxyrbose
  - Phosphate
  - Nitrogonous base
+ Chagaffs rule
  - Purines: adenine (A), guanine (G)
  - Pyrimidines: Cytosine (C), Thymine (T)
  - Amounts roughly A = T, and C = G
+ Franklins Xray images
  - Take images to find chemical compositions of stuff like salts
  - But also works for more complicated structures like DNA
  - Key to understanding structure of DNA but was used without consent lol
+ Double strand DNA
  - Outside is the sugar-phosphate backbone
  - Inside is the nitrogonous bases (these come in pairs
  - The DNA is right-handed spiraled
  - Right hand rule up the thumb, around the fingers
  - The two strans are anti-parallel (they run in opossite directions?)
  - There's a contour to the DNA, like wobblines (DNA helix ain straight)
  - There are major and minor groves (bending kinda) in the DNA
  - Single stranded DNA is a different thing
