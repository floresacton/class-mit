== DNA

Chargaffs rule about A=T C=G

nucleotide triphosphate\
its like a chain with the sugar base (ribose) with the nitrogen base

1' position is the carbon on the ribose that connects to the nitrogen base
then around to the other carbon is 5'

G is deoxyribonucleotide

DNA does not have OH group on 2' carbon, but RNA does

The hydrogen on the 3' carbon goes away and the Oxygen bonds to the first phosphorous on the
chain of the next DNA triphosphate ( phosphodiester linkage )

The C and G base pairs combine with hydrogen bonds\
C and G is 3 hydrogen bonds, A and T is 3 hydrogen bonds

for double stranded dna, one strand goes 5' to 3' and the other goes 3' to 5' (antiparrallel)

major and minor groves because one faces up and one faces down so the phosphates are closer (minor groove)

A-form DNA is where the bonds are twisted, so the major and minor grooves don't really show up\
B-form DNA is normally bonded nitrides

== Watson and Chris

DNA is information storage\
predics mechanism for replication
mutation = change in DNA sequence

length of DNA in number of nucleotide pairs ( base pairs )

human genome is 3 Gigabases

B-form DNA is 10.5 base pairs / turn
diameter of DNA is 2nm

e-coli genome is 4 Mega bases

T2 genome is 100 kilo bases

stretching out the genome of e-coli is 1mm, but the cell is 1um

== DNA replication

DNA -> RNA -> protien

dNTPs: dGPT, dCTP, dATP, dTTP\
need a template\
need an ensyme to polymerate DNA together: DNA polymerase

sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim: drugs that block DNA replication in bacteria

models: conservative, semi-conservative, dispersive\
conservative is stay the same and make new independent copy\
semi-conservative is they split in half and replicate the other half\
dispersive is some mix of the two which would be cooked

=== meselson/stahl\
take ecoli and grow it in Nitrogen 15\
The heavy nitrogen gets incorpirated in the DNA\
switch them and grow them in regular nitrogen\
The DNA is centrefuged for both, and the DNA after regular N becomes lighter

Run the process twice and see the layers shift again

=== elongation\
always extending from 5' to 3'\
diphosphate is broken and released to be replaced with the 3' OH bond
The OH bonds is free to the next thing which keeps the DNA polymerase going

=== Arthur Kornberg\
dNTPs + template but didn't work\
Also need a primer to show DNA polymerase to where to start\
Primer is the first little part of double stranded DNA\

Ecoli has like 4000 protiens\
Lyse the cells during ecoli replication process to try and find DNA polymerase\
start fractionating ly states (maybe mass, charge, hybrophorisity)\
take various fractions, add different fractions to the primed DNA, see which one extends the chain

he found DNA pol 1, however the actual one that does it in the cell is DNA pol 3\
DNA pol 1 is sufficient, but it wasn't necessary rip\
